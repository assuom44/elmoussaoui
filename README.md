## 🧠 Research Summary

My research focuses on developing **intelligent**, **decentralized**, and **privacy-preserving systems** through the use of **artificial intelligence (AI)**, **machine learning (ML)**, and **data mining**. I am particularly interested in the application of these methods to **real-world complex networks**, **community detection**, and **user behavior modeling**, with a strong emphasis on **ethical**, **scalable**, and **interpretable** AI.

My PhD thesis is titled:  
**"Towards Community Detection in Social Networks: Integration of Association Rules, Fuzzy Logic, and Artificial Intelligence"**
